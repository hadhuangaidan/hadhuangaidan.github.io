Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), a promising energy harvesting technology for distributed power sources, faces inevitable issues regarding long-term wear and durability. However, current low-wear TENGs are impaired by lower performances due to low charge density. Here, we propose to address both issues using a double charge supplement TENG (DCS-TENG). Adding two low friction charge brushes allows the DCS-TENG to achieve a high surface charge density (76.5 μC m−2) and power density (697.5 mW m−2 Hz-1), setting a new record among previously reported low-wear TENGs. Moreover, the device exhibits unprecedented durability with an attenuation of only 5% after continuous operation for 110 h (3,960,000 cycles). Using a customized energy management module, a 3×7 hygrothermograph array, a high-power vehicle’s radar and accelerometer modules were stably powered, demonstrating the DCS-TENG’s strong electrical load capacity. This strategy provides a facile and effective path to conjointly boost power output and durability of TENGs, taking them to the next level for practical applications.
